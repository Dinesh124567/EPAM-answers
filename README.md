# EPAM-answers
EPAM coding answers are solved in here on my own., you can ask more coding questions in comments.
since i got only two questions known, if you know any other questions i would appreciate to share the questions with all description in the issues section or anywhere so that i can reach the questions.

# PlusMin
   for given integer input do the addition or subtraction for individual digits to sum to zero, if sum is not zero in all possible additions or subractions then print - not possible.
    
    input - contains first line with one integer 
    output - contains string that represents the sequence of operations
    Example-
    input - 1313
    output -  +--
    Explanation -  1+3-1-3=0 so the output is string sequence of the operations for sum to zero.
    
 # Character Remove
   an array of two elements of string one containing an individual word and another containing words seperated by ',' we term here dictionary. your task is to remove the charecters from the first word (individual word) to match any of the words from the dictionary 
    that the number of charecters removed is minimum and print that minimum number as an output, if any word from dictionary is not matched then print not possible. 
   
    input- contains two lines
            first line contains individual seperate word or ordinary word
            second line contains dictionary ie words seperated by commas
    output- one line that gives the minimum charecter removel number as above described, or "not possible" if not matched
    
    example -
     input- baseball
            all,ll,se,zz,ball
    output- 4
    explanation- the minimum noof charecter to be removed from word baseball is 4 as b,a,s,e are removed to match 'ball' word from dictionary.
